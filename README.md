# About the app

This app fetches a list of events from an API and shows them chronologically ordered by date.
You can get the Google link to the location by clicking the location icon. 
You can also see an info text by clicking the info icon, but only if there is a description coming from the backend.
When adding an event to the shopping cart, it will automatically be removed from the list.
The number of items at the shopping cart will be increased.
If you click the X by the shopping cart, the number is back to 0 and the events reappear in the list.
In the search field you can search for events.
The events are grouped by their date. If you click the hovering bar with the dedicated date, you jump to the top of the page.
There is a loading spinner when the page is loading.

# How to start the project

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install` 

To install the packages.

### `npm start`

To start the project.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
